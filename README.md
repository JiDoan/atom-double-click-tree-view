# double-click-tree-view-fork package for atom editor

By default, the atom tree-view for browsing files/directories will open a file or collapse / expand
a directory listing just by single-clicking on the entry.

This package forces the user to double click on a file to open it, or on a directory to expand/collapse it. This effectively turns a single-click into just selecting the item clicked on, which is the default behavior in most editors.

This fork allows single clicking on chevrons next to folder icons.

To install: Unpack to your plugins folder.
